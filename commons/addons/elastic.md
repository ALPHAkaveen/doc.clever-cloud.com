The Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack). Reliably and securely take data from any source, in any format, then search, analyze, and visualize it in real time. Find out more about it on [Elastic's website](https://www.elastic.co/products/elastic-stack).

Provisioning the Elastic Stack addon on Clever Cloud will give you an Elasticsearch instance, Kibana and an APM server.

## Elastic Stack version

The version currently installed by the add-on is 7.4.2.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

## Kibana

Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack so you can do anything from tracking query load to understanding the way requests flow through your apps.

## Elastic APM

Elastic APM is an Application performance management tool chain based on the Elastic Stack. See exactly where your application is spending time so you can quickly fix issues and feel good about the code you push. 

## Logs

You can redirect your application logs directly in Elasticsearch and visualize them in Kibana.
